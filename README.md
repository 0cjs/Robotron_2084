# Robotron_2084
reverse engineering Robotron 2084 for the Apple ][

# Virtu
Main project dependency is with Sean Fausett's [Virtu](https://github.com/digital-jellyfish/Virtu), actually the [hex-ray branch](https://github.com/sicklittlemonkey/Virtu/tree/hex-ray) by Nick Westgate, his collaborator. 

Virtu has been abstracted to a software framework which can take advantage of the various implementations, namely WPF, Silverlight and XNA. It's a really nice piece of software, and it works like a charm.

If you want to run the C# software in this repo you'll need to clone [my fork](https://github.com/fschuhi/Virtu/tree/hex-ray).

# Usage

The goal of sotware in this repo is to reverse engineer Robotron 2084 for the Apple II. In this regard, Virtu and emulator/debugger features built on top of it are an important part of the toolbox.

As of now, everything in this repo is work in progress. The software is supposed to further my understanding of the executable. This repo collects my own progress; it does not want to be more than that.
